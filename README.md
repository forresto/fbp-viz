# fbp-viz

Rewrite of [noflo/visualize](https://github.com/noflo/visualize) with simpler stack, relying on [klay-js]() for layout and canvas for rendering.

## todo / ideas

- [ ] Graph in/outports
- [ ] Colors and magic numbers to theme config
- [ ] Example of FBPâ†’PNG rendering from command line using [node-canvas]()
- [ ] SVG renderer, switchable
- [ ] Animate changes while editing
- [ ] [fbp-diff](https://github.com/flowbased/fbp-diff) visualization (green and red nodes and edges, let KLay layout?)
